# Project Renamed

On 8/26/2025, the `fastly-operator` project was renamed to `fastly-tls-operator`.

You can find the project [in its new location](https://github.com/seatgeek/fastly-tls-operator).

## Rationale

The name `fastly-operator` might have implied that the operator would be used to configure Fastly in general via Kubernetes.

The intention of this project was to configure tls automation, and nothing else. We think that the new name of `fastly-tls-operator` more accurately conveys intent.
